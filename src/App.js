        <h1>My React Web Page</h1>
        <p>
          This page was created using React. Here, I explain how I installed React,
          how I built the page, and the challenges I faced.
        </p>
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>React was installed using <code>npx create-react-app my-react-site</code>.</p>
        <h2>How I Built This Page</h2>
        <p>I navigated the directories that were made during the create-react-app command to find App.js and modified it to include this text using simple javascript. Then I added styling in App.css.</p>
        <p>I connected to GitHub by using the repository automatically initialized by React during the create-react-app command and deployed the project directly from that GitHub repository using Netlify.</p>
        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <ul>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Knowing what commands to use and how to navigate the React project directories.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Referenced React documentation and tutorials.</p>
          <p><strong>Challenge:</strong>I didnâ€™t know how to host the React project after building it.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution:</strong>I researched hosting services, found Netlify, created an account, and followed its simple steps to deploy directly from GitHub.</p>
